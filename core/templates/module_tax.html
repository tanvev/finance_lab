<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-trust dark:text-blue-300">What You Will Learn</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base mt-1">
Taxes might look like ancient Sanskrit written on a scroll, but we’re here to decode the simple rules. We'll arm you with the knowledge on deductions, HRA, capital gains, and more. Think of this as unlocking your financial cheat codes—and unlike your last dating phase, this one is worth the effort.</p>


<!-- CARD 1 -->
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-8 shadow-md border dark:border-gray-700 mt-6">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-trust dark:text-blue-300">What Even *Is* Income Tax?</h3>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base mt-3">
    Income tax is the mandatory annual subscription fee that keeps the country running. It funds everything from the roads you complain about on Twitter to the UPI payment system that actually works. It's basically paying for India’s operating system—and yes, you have to reboot it every year.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base mt-4 font-semibold">5 Heads of Income:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base">
    <li><strong>Salary : </strong>Your regular paycheck. The one your employer already took tax from (TDS). Thanks, I hate it.</li>
    <li><strong>House Property : </strong>Rental income. If you own one, congratulations, you're that person.</li>
    <li><strong>Capital Gains : </strong>The profit (or loss) from selling assets like stocks or that overpriced flat.</li>
    <li><strong>Business / Profession : </strong>Earnings from your side-hustle or main-hustle. The government always knows.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Sources : </strong>The financial leftovers—like interest from your "emergency" FD or that time you actually won the lottery. (Don't forget to report this, seriously.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base mt-4">
    Deductions like <span class="bg-yellow-200 px-1 rounded font-semibold">80C/80D</span> reduce taxable income —
    <strong class="text-blue-700">basically discount codes.</strong>They allow you to reduce your Taxable Income—meaning you pay tax on a lower amount. It’s the ultimate jugaad (hack) but it's 100% legal.

<!-- CARD 2: OLD VS NEW -->
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-8 shadow-md border dark:border-gray-700 mt-12">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-trust dark:text-blue-300">Old vs New Tax Regime</h3>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base mt-3">
    Old = customise with deductions • New = simpler with lower slabs.
  </p>

  <div class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-10 mt-6">
    <div>
      <h4 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">✨ Old Regime</h4>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base">
        <li>High effort, high reward. The one your CA loves. Requires actual planning and receipts.</li>
        <li>Includes HRA, the full ₹1.5L from 80C, 80D (Health Insurance), and the home loan interest benefit.</li>
        <li>Hard Mode. You must actively opt for this regime and gather all the receipts.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">⚡ New Regime</h4>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base">
        <li>Low effort, low reward (for most). The government’s default choice. Zero brain cells required.</li>
        <li>Lower tax slabs (technically, you pay less at certain income points). Also gets a Standard Deduction</li>
        <li>Easy Mode. The automatic default. File and forget (mostly)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<!-- CARD 3: HRA -->
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-8 shadow-md border dark:border-gray-700 mt-12">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-trust dark:text-blue-300">HRA (House Rent Allowance)</h3>

  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base mt-3">If you're still not that person who owns property, this is your small victory. HRA allows a reduction in your taxable salary. The government checks your math and only exempts the minimum of these three:</p>

  <ol class="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base">
    <li>Actual HRA received (The number your HR sent)</li>
    <li>Rent paid MINUS 10% of (Basic Salary + DA) (The actual formula that makes you feel financially illiterate)</li>
    <li>50% of (Basic Salary + DA) (Metro cities: Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata) / 40% (Non-metro cities)</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base mt-4">
    If your annual rent is over ₹1 Lakh, you must provide your landlord's PAN. If they don't have one? Get a legal declaration. Don't let your landlord's lack of compliance ruin your tax game.

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-trust dark:text-blue-300">Capital Gains: The Asset Sale Tax</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base mt-4">This is the tax on profit from selling assets. If you trade options, congratulations, you probably have a Business/Profession income, not a simple Capital Gain.</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base">

<!-- CARD 6: COMMON MISTAKES -->
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-8 shadow-md border dark:border-gray-700 mt-12">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-trust dark:text-blue-300">Common Mistakes Beginners Make</h3>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Not reporting savings interest : </strong>The most common rookie mistake. You report the income first, then claim the 80TTA deduction (up to ₹10,000).</li>
    <li><strong>Using the Wrong ITR Form : </strong>Did you sell a share? You probably can't use ITR-1. Did you run a business? You need ITR-3 or ITR-4 (Sugam). Pick wisely.</li>
    <li><strong>Mismatching TDS with 26AS/AIS : </strong>Your employer said they deducted ₹X, but 26AS says ₹Y. Trust 26AS. Get the mismatch corrected by the deductor (your employer/bank) before filing..</li>
    <li><strong>Not Verifying the ITR : </strong>Filing is only half the battle. You must e-Verify your return (via Aadhaar OTP, Net Banking, etc.) within 30 days, or your return is considered never filed. It’s a literal "click this button or it never happened" scenario.</li>
  </ul>
